What we should take in consideration during development:
1. It's a public repo, so no private data should be commited
2. We already have this app implemented, we need to re-use as many code as possible.
3. This app should be fast. Integrate Lighthouse from the very beginning. Our goal is 100 points on each category
4. We shouldn't touch back-end of the existing app. All blog data should live in wordpress, we will retrieve it with gatsby wordpress plugin
